# Empedance_Measurement_Experiment_of_Antenna
In this experiment, we were trying to find the beam frequency limits of the LHC BCTDC with using Pulse Generator and an antenna system.
Inputs were basically generated from Pulse Generator with differen width and voltage levels, outputs are taken via an integrator.
